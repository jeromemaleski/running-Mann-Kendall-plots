# running-Mann-Kendall-plots
plot running mann-kendall trends

This is a set of MATLAB scripts for creating the figures in:

Example data is included in an excel file.  
Run scripts in this order:  
1 calculate running mann kendall (RMK_annual)  
2 calculate field significance (RMK_FS_annual)  
3 plot (plot_annual_RMK)  

Example Figure Mean Tempearture trends (grey outlines indicate field signifcant trends)
